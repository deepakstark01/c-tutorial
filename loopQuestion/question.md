Here are 10 beginner-level questions related to the output of `for` loops in C:  

1. **Understanding Output:**  
   What will be the output of the following loop?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 2; i < 10; i = i + 2) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
2. **Modifying Step Size:**  
   What happens if we change `i = i + 2` to `i = i + 5` in the loop below?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 2; i < 20; i = i + 5) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
3. **Changing Condition:**  
   What will happen if we change `i < 100` to `i <= 100` in the following loop?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 2; i < 100; i = i + 2) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
4. **Using `printf` Inside the Loop:**  
   What will be printed by this loop?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
   }
   ```
   
5. **Infinite Loop Possibility:**  
   How can we modify the following `for` loop to make it run forever?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
6. **Reverse Counting:**  
   What will be the output of this loop?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 10; i > 0; i = i - 2) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
7. **Skipping Numbers:**  
   How can you modify this loop to print only odd numbers from 1 to 19?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 1; i < 20; i = i + 2) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
8. **Loop with Multiple Variables:**  
   What will be printed by the following loop?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 1, j = 2; i < 5; i++, j = j + 2) {
       printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
   }
   ```
   
9. **Loop Condition Change:**  
   What will happen if we write `i <= 50` instead of `i < 50` in this loop?  
   ```c
   for (int i = 10; i < 50; i = i + 10) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```
   
10. **Loop Without Initialization:**  
   Is the following loop valid? What will it print?  
   ```c
   int i = 2;
   for (; i < 10; i = i + 2) {
       printf("%d, ", i);
   }
   ```

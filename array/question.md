Here are three beginner-friendly C programming questions on arrays:  

### **1. Sum of Array Elements**  
Write a C program that takes an array of integers from the user (size 5) and calculates the sum of all elements.  

**Example:**  
```
Input:  1 2 3 4 5  
Output: Sum = 15  
```

### **2. Find the Largest Element in an Array**  
Write a C program that takes an array of 10 integers from the user and finds the largest number in the array.  

**Example:**  
```
Input:  5 8 12 3 15 7 9 10 4 6  
Output: Largest element = 15  
```

### **3. Reverse an Array**  
Write a C program that takes an array of 6 integers from the user and prints the elements in reverse order.  

**Example:**  
```
Input:  10 20 30 40 50 60  
Output: 60 50 40 30 20 10  
```

It seems like you're asking for beginner-level C programming questions related to structures, especially since you’ve just completed a student ID program. I’ll assume you’re familiar with basic structure syntax and want some practice questions to build on that. Here are three beginner-friendly questions involving structures in C, tailored to your level:

---

### Question 1: Simple Student Record
Write a C program to create a structure called `Student` that stores a student's name (up to 50 characters), roll number (integer), and marks (float). Declare a variable of this structure, take input from the user for one student, and then display the entered details.

*Hint*: Use `scanf` for input and `printf` for output. Make sure to handle the string input correctly with spaces.

### Question 2: Book Inventory
Create a structure called `Book` with members: title (string up to 100 characters), author (string up to 50 characters), and price (float). Write a program to:
1. Declare an array of 3 books using this structure.
2. Take input for all 3 books from the user.
3. Display the details of all books in a neat format.

*Hint*: Use a loop to input and display the data for multiple books.

### Question 3: Employee Details
Define a structure called `Employee` with members: ID (integer), name (string up to 50 characters), and salary (double). Write a program to:
1. Declare a single employee variable.
2. Take input for the employee’s details.
3. If the salary is greater than 50000, increase it by 10% and display the updated details. Otherwise, display the details as they are.

*Hint*: Use an `if` condition to check the salary and calculate the increase.
